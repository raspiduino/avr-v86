# avr-v86
IBM PC XT emulator on Arduino UNO<br>
<b>Under development, please wait some more weeks!</b><br>
<b>This project is almost completed! It's time for testing!</b><br>
<b>Super buggy since switching to virtual memory file on SD instead of a ram array.</b><br>
<b>Now switched to Arduino's standard SD library for supporting FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.</b><br>

> Sketch uses 21932 bytes (67%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes. <br>
> Global variables use 993 bytes (48%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1055 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

You can now see the development progress of the project in the code, but it's not completed yet, so please don't use it now!
